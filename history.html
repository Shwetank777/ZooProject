							Green Gates Zoological Park is situated on the
							fringes of industrial city of Kanpur. The Park is
							spread in an area of 76.56 hectare. It is part of
							lush green Allen-forest. The construction of the
							Park started in the year 1971 and has been developed
							on the modern management principles. It opened for
							public on 4th February 1974. In the last three
							decades the Zoological Park has played an important
							role in the care of wildlife and awareness of masses
							regarding wildlife conservation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Allen forest was developed during the British rule
							between the years 1913-1918 by Mr. George Burney
							Allen, a famous British industrialist of Green
							Gates. The forest has been developed on the banks of
							the river Ganga. This was a Rest place of Mr.Allen.
							He constructed a rest house called lake view on the
							banks of a lake. The lake had a continuous water
							supply from Ramganga canal. During rains the water
							use to overflow from the lake and fall in to Ganges.
							Due to this, many a times big fishes and tortoises
							use to escape in to the river Ganges. To keep a
							check on it a bund has been built with sluice gates.
							In the British, rule this area was situated 5 K.M.
							away from the city and was a hunting place for
							English-Business men. Due to the efforts of Mr.
							George Burney Allen and the then Governor, it was
							taken into Government possession. A lake, spread in
							an area of 18 hectares, is a center of attraction
							since the beginning, as many fishes were in the lake
							and water birds use to visit the area regularly. The
							continuously increasing population was a threat to
							the Allen Forest as there were chances of
							destruction of this forest due to the increasing
							biotic interference. Because of the far sightedness
							of the state Government and the forest department,
							this chunk of forest area has been converted into a
							modern Zoological Park.
						</p>
						<p>
							Construction of the Zoological Park started in the
							year 1971 and by the year 1975-1976 first 10
							enclosures were built. Mr. R. S. Bhaduria was
							appointed as the first Director of Green Gates
							Zoological Park, in the year 1971. It was a great
							challenge for him to convert this area in to a zoo
							because at that time the entire forest area was
							known for the criminal activities. Many times the
							people who were involved in illegal fishing were
							punished. This also led sometimes to bloody struggle
							with the people who indulged in illegal fishing in
							the zoo's lake. In the first phase of the
							development of the Zoological Park three enclosures
							were constructed. The 1st animal that came to the
							zoo was an Otter, gifted to the Director by one of
							his relatives from Etawah, which was caught by
							fisherman from the river Chambal.
						</p>
						<p>
							The construction of the Zoological Park had started
							in April 1971 and by the end of 1973 about half of
							the construction had been completed. Many animals
							were brought in and the number of visitors also
							increased. Later an official inaugural of the zoo
							was organized with the advice of Mr. N.D. Bachkheti,
							the Conservator of Forests, southern circle,
							Allahabad, under whose official control and
							direction the Zoological Park was constructed.
							According to Mr. Bachkheti, the Zoological Park was
							the children's favorite entertainer. Hence the zoo
							was inaugurated by a child on the 4th of Feb. 1974
							in the early hours, in a very simple ceremony in the
							Zoo and it was made open for the public.
						</p>
						<p>
							Initially 10 enclosures were proposed and
							constructed from the year 1971-72 to 1975-76. The
							enclosures were designed according to the modern
							management principles. Every enclosure had ample
							greenery so that the animals could feel at home
							between the natural available atmosphere. Feeding
							houses were also constructed with squeeze cages in
							the houses of the tiger, lion, leopard and other
							similar species. This arrangement was very helpful
							for the treatment when they were sick. Moat of the
							Tiger enclosure have been so designed that there is
							sufficient water in it for the tiger to play and it
							is pleasant and pleasing sight for the visitors.
							Later many more enclosures were added to accommodate
							various other animals and various development works
							continued and were added from time to time every
							year, according to the provisions of the budget of
							the State Government and Central Zoo Authority
							(CZA).
						</p>
						<p>
							The enclosures for animals and birds were designed
							on the latest trends in the field of zoo building
							technology, well spread along the lake on either
							side of a semicircular arterial road of about 9 km.
							length, in such a manner that the natural look of
							the forest was not disturbed and the natural
							topography and floral richness of Allen Forest was
							fully utilized.
						</p>
						<p>
							Though so many enclosures, buildings and roads are
							constructed in the zoo premises, still there is vast
							untouched area, which gives it a look of dense
							forest. Subsequently, a variety of free roaming
							animals are thriving in the zoo premises. These
							consist of Spotted deer, rhesus monkeys Hanuman
							Langurs, many common civets, hares, porcupines,
							squirrels, bats, mongoose, lizards, snakes, pythons,
							common pea fowls, partridges, parakeets, owls and a
							variety of birds etc.
